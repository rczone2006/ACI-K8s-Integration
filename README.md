# Deploy ACI and Kubernetes Integration
 The script only works for VMware environment, but can be replicated to bare metal with modifications. It's tested on ACI 5.2(1g), Ubuntu 20.04TLS, Kubernetes 1.21, and Vsphere 7.0. Most of the parameters needed in hosts and gvar.yml are self explained after you have a good understanding of acc provision tool.  Proxy environment is a big hassle, if your environment is proxy-free, you need to comment out the lines calling the environment variable defined in gvar.yml from all related scripts. 

## Requirements
- Python 

- Ansible

- PyVmomi 

## How to use

#### Step 1. Create a VM template and name the template as aci-k8s-template

- Install Ubuntu 18.04+
- Install python3-pip
- Add a second network adapter pointing to nowhere i.e "dummy"
- Genenerate and copy public key from management station to VM
  - ssh-keygen -t rsa
  - ssh-copy-id  <VM>

- configure sudo without password prompt
- Setup proxy for the following (skip this step if you donâ€™t need internect connection via proxy)
  - Enviroment
  - Docker
  - APT
#### Step 2. Clone repo to the home directory of the managment station
#### Step 3. Prepare the acc-provision template file and name the file name as aci-fabric.yaml
  - Save the aci-fabric.yaml in aci-kube directory
  - ACI Configuration Guide for reference:

#### Step 4. Edit params in hosts and gvar.yml files to match up acc-provision template and IP scheme planned
  
#### Step 5. Exceution
      change to aci-kube directory
      
      ansible-playbook -i hosts --become --become-user=root k8s-cluster.yml
